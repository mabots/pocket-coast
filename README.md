## Why this app?
* Some of my friends say they'd purchased some CDs which play sounds of nature.
* And also it can be said when we see bunch of simlar types of youtube videos.

## Abstract
* Providing relaxing nature sounds taken by mabots.
* Adding some mechanism which won't get you bored.
* Users can enjoy various sounds which come with frequent updates or updates could be done by server side operation.
** The app size should be small enough.
